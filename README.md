This is an example of end user Karen creating a ticket. The help topic is "Business Critical Outage" because customers are reporting that they keep seeing an 404 error when browsing mobile banking.

These are the tickets that agents will be able to see live in the agent panel, adjust permissions via admin panel if need be. The admin will assign  priority tickets, along with SLA's to the best fit agents for that ticket.

In this example, we are setting the ticket's priority level. Given that we are dealing with a problem that has the potential to affect a large percentage of the business, the priority has been set to Emergency. The SLA plan has been modified to Sev A, and the best fit technician has been given the ticket. Customers can create their own unique SLA plans in some ticketing systems.
